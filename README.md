Final Exam: Model Deployment in the Cloud
submitted by: Kenneth Llave and Anjela Ca√±esa

In this project, we used a CNN model that is deployed to the cloud via a webapp.
In the model used in the webapp, we chose the multi-class weather dataset.
The dataset contains 4 categories, sunshine, sunset, rainy, and cloudy.
Our model can predict whether the image being processed is in any of these categories.
The model itself has an accuracy of around 80% after training and testing.
In the webapp, values closer to 1.0 are considered to be more accurate predictions.
